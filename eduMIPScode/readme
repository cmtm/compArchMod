EduMIPS64 README
================

EduMIPS64 is a cross-platform visual MIPS64 CPU simulator written in
Java/swing. To learn how it works and how to use it, please refer to the
EduMIPS64 User Manual (in the docs/{en,it}/output/latex directory). This file
is a short guide for developers.

Requirements
------------

In order to compile EduMIPS64, you need the following tools:
- Java JDK version 1.5 or above (tested only with Sun JDK)
- Apache Ant version 1.8 or above (needed for JUnit 4 tests)

If you need to compile the in-application help, you need:
- Sphinx (http://sphinx.pocoo.org/) versione 1.0.7 or above
- GNU Make

If you need to compile the PDF manual, you will also need:
- latex / pdflatex

If you need to run unit tests, or build the javadoc, you will also need:
- JUnit version 4

Main Ant targets
----------------

* `jar` builds the jar package named edumips64-`version`.jar

* `docs` builds the user documentation (both in-app HTML and PDF)

* `clean` removes the jar files, the build directory and the compiled
  documentation

* `tests` runs unit tests; it depends on junit4.jar being added to the
  CLASSPATH environment variable

* `debugjar` builds a jar package that contains more debug information

* `clijar` build a jar package containing an experimental CLI front-end

* `src-release` builds a tar.bz2 file containing the source distribution

* `javadoc` builds the javadoc documentation (depends on junit4.jar being
  in CLASSPATH); will store it in the `javadoc` directory.
