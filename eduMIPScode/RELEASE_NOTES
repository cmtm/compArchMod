                           EduMIPS64 RELEASE NOTES	
                           http://www.edumips.org

EduMIPS64 is a GPL MIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) simulator and
graphical debugger.

Notes for this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is version 1.0 of EduMIPS64, the first major one since 2007. The codename
for this release is "Philadelphia", since it is being released from
Philadelphia (PA), in the USA.

The simulator has proven to be quite stable in the last years, and only 4
bugfix releases have been necessary (less than one per year) despite the
simulator is being used yearly by a few hundred people.

The 2 big new features since 0.5 are the Floating Point Unit (FPU) support,
written by Massimo Trubia (max83t) and the new help system based on RST, that
allows to create both in-app HTML-based help and PDF documentation from a
single source.

These new features and the demonstrated stability led us to dare to use the
dreaded 1.0 version number. To keep the software stable, unit tests have been
added, and even if the coverage is not great the framework will help us to
keep improving the quality of the code.

Please keep in mind that this is still EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE. It may
BURN YOUR HARD DISK, DESTROY ALL YOUR DATA and even GO OUT WITH YOUR
WIFE/HUSBAND. :)

If you find a bug, please send us a bug report to bugs@edumips.org.

If you use the simulator, please consider subscribing to the low-traffic
mailing-list edumips64-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, and help us by giving us
suggestions and sending bug reports. Thanks!

EduMIPS64 is now hosted on GitHub (www.github.com/lupino3/edumips64), and we
have a git mirror (that lags a bit) on Google Code
(http://code.google.com/p/edumips64/). Our web site is www.edumips.org and we
still use it to communicate with our users. Releases are done on Sourceforge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/edumips64) and we also have a development
blog on http://edumips64.blogspot.com.
